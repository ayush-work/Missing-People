# A Community Connect project - App for Missing People Reports


# PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
Manual systems for finding missing person have very long procedures and take more time. More time is required for launching an FIR (First Information Report) in a police station. Also time required for finding a lost person is more. Also during manual processes the number of manpower for searching lost persons is less. Some existing applications do not show the proper information about the Missing person, which is difficult to find out. Some missing person related websites only show the database of missing people. To overcome this, some android applications have been developed. But these applications has certain limitations as
Problems in Existing Android Applications:
Previous applications only contain links which redirect to their website.  
User can not add complaint
It displays advertisements collected from newspapers. 


# PROPOSED STATEMENT

This application is basically designed to perform all the tasks that the previous system can perform, all functionalities that are provided by existing applications as well as it gives additional features to the user. It will be for all android devices which support at least Android Platform. 
Proposed System will contain following features: 
Display Information about missing person.
Adding a new complaint. 
Removing Complaints.  
Searching for a person by particular attribute such as name, location   etc.
Notification Portal.

# STATISTICS
Each year State/UT police receive numerous reports of missing persons. Some of them return soon after their disappearance without any harm having befallen them. However, some of them might have been met with tragic end such as homicide, suicide or an accident. It is also possible that they might have been a victim of foul play such as trafficking. However, it is difficult to ascertain whether someoneâ€™s disappearance is intentional or unintentional.
